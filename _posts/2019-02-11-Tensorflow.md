## 1.1 Why Tensorflow?
**Tensorflow** is a library for machine learning, especially deep learning program which makes us able to create codes much easier. This library is made by google and we can easily use in Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Ios, etc. 

But we should note that Tensorflow is not the only library for machine/deep learning. * *Torch, Caffe, MXNet, CNTK, * * etc. 

So why use Tensorflow??

My answer is that Tensorflow has a large community! For an engineer like me, fixing problems and debugging is really important. Also a lot of engineers now use Tensorflow and we can see that most of the codes in github are using Tensorflow. In Korea, there is a special community in Facebook called TensorFlow KR which we can share a lot of information.

Iâ€™m not saying that other libraries are bad~ But, if you want to start learning about libraries or deep learning, I recommend you to start from learning Tensorflow!!! My codes in this blog will mostly be done in Tensorflow too.
